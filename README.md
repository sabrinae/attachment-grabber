# attachment-grabber
Python script that pulls out attachments from Outlook emails and saves them to a shared server


I have regular Google Analytics reports that are sent to my email, where they are filtered into a specific folder automatically. This script goes into this folder, finds emails with a specific subject that are <i>unread</i>, grabs the csv attachment, saves the attachment in my company's shared server, and marks the email as read when it's done.
